Interpreted languages (like Python) translate and execute code *line by line* at runtime, which can be slower but offers more flexibility. Python uses an intermediate bytecode step, but it's still considered an interpreted language because the bytecode is executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM) at runtime.  Essentially, compiled languages are like having a complete translated book, while interpreted languages are like having a translator reading and translating line by line as you listen.\n"
